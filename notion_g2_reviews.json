        "review": "What do you like best about Notion?\nI use Notion like a second brain, dumping thoughts and tracking growth without feeling pressured for perfection. I love that it doesn't rush me or scream with notifications, just waits until I'm ready. Whether it's a busy day or a quiet day, I like that it's flexible and meets me where I am. If my brain feels organized, I can build clean systems. Overall, Notion gives my brain a place to rest, allowing me to write things down and not have to carry them around anymore.\nWhat do you dislike about Notion?\nOne big thing is speed. When my internet is slow or I just want to quickly jot something down, Notion can feel a bit heavy. Sometimes I don't want a powerful workspace, I just want instant writing and Notion is not always the fastest for that.",

It would be helpful if the features people use most were available on the home screen with bigger icons.",

And I like that it allows you to create sort of a front page for each part of the company. So marketing can have a page link to all their different documents and everyone knows where to find things.\nWhat do you dislike about Notion?\nIt's not the best for long ongoing work documents. We were trying to track a list of emails, and it got very unwieldy, and it was very hard to comment on things. The comment feature doesn't take you to where the comment is, and so it's hard to have sort of a big ongoing document in Notion.",
